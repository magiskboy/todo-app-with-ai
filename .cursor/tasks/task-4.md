# Task 4: Migrate from Pure CSS to Ant Design

## Implementation Plan

1. **Install Ant Design**
   - Add Ant Design to the project dependencies using npm or yarn.
   - Import Ant Design's global styles in the app entry point.

2. **Audit Current Components and Styles**
   - List all components currently using pure CSS modules (e.g., Button, Layout, TaskForm, TaskList, TaskItem, Login).
   - Identify all custom CSS that can be replaced by Ant Design components or styles.

3. **Replace UI Components with Ant Design Equivalents**
   - Replace custom Button with Ant Design's `Button`.
   - Replace form elements (inputs, selects, textarea) with Ant Design's `Form`, `Input`, `Select`, `DatePicker`, etc.
   - Replace layout elements (header, container) with Ant Design's `Layout`, `Header`, `Content`, etc.
   - Replace lists and items with Ant Design's `List`, `Card`, or similar components.
   - Use Ant Design's `Avatar`, `Typography`, and other relevant components for user info and text.

4. **Remove or Refactor Custom CSS**
   - Remove CSS modules that are fully replaced by Ant Design.
   - Refactor any remaining custom styles to work alongside Ant Design if needed (for unique branding or overrides).

5. **Ensure Responsiveness**
   - Use Ant Design's Grid and responsive utilities to maintain mobile-first and desktop layouts.
   - Test all views on mobile and desktop.

6. **Test All Functionality**
   - Ensure all features (login, task CRUD, user info display) work as expected with the new Ant Design components.
   - Fix any UI or interaction issues.

7. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README and code comments to reflect the use of Ant Design and any new conventions.
